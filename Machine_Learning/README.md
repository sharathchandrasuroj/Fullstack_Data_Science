# Machine Learning

- Machine Learning involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to       enable computer systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions

- Machine Learning is maojorly divided in Four main parts 
  - Supervised Machine Learning : Here Machine is trained with availabel data/dataset to predict output 
  - Unsupervised Machine Learning : Unsupervised learning algorithms are not provided with any specific output variable or label. Instead, the algorithm is tasked with finding patterns and relationships within the data.
  - Semi-Supervised Machine Learning : Semi-supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning that combines both supervised and unsupervised learning. It is used when a dataset contains both labeled and unlabeled data, and the goal is to improve the accuracy of the supervised learning model by leveraging the information from the unlabeled data.
  - Reinforcement Machine Learning : Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning in which an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on its actions, and its goal is to learn a policy that maximizes the cumulative reward over time.

- Supervised Machine Learning: We have various Algorithms to predict output based on given data.So based on this It is further divided into two categories
    - Regression Problem : Here our output predicted is Continous/Discrete data variable that is quantitative/non- categorical variable.
    - Based on this we further have algorithms to predict the outcome.
        - Linear Regression (Linear relation between input and output feature)
            - Simple Linear Regression (One independent input feature)
            - Multiple Linear Regression (Multiple independent input features)
        - Polynomial Regression (Polynomial relation between input and output feature)
            - Simple Polynomial Regression (One independent input feature)
            - Multiple Polynomail Regression (Multiple independent input features)
        - Logistic Regressor
        - Decision Tree Regressor
        - Support Vector Regressor
    - Classification Problem : Here our output predicted is categorical data variable that is qualitative data variable.
    - Based on this we further have algorithms to predict the outcome.
        - Logistic Classifier
        - Decision Tree Classifier
        - Support Vector Classifier
        - Naive Bayes 
            - Bernoulli Naive Bayes (Binary Classification Independent Input features)
            - Multinomial Naive Bayes (Independent Input features are in text form)
            - Gaussian Naive Bayes (Whenever independent input features are following gaussian curve or bell curev)

    - Ensemble Technique -  Combining multuiple models to train and predict outcome
        - Bagging Technique
            - Random Forest Classifier and Regressor
        - Boosting Technique
            - Adaboost
            - Gradient Boost
            - XgBoost
